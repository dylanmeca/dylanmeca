# Dylan Meca

I'm Dylan Meca, scientist and computer engineer and an amateur computer programmer.

Thanks to my computer science studies, I learned more about the cyber world, I also learned about computer security and I realized that we can improve our systems through security tests to make them more secure. 🛡️

I am currently creating software, to improve technology and the future.
