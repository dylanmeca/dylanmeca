# Dylan Meca

I am Dylan Meca, a student specialized in computer science, especially in the area of artificial intelligence and I also specialize in the area of mathematics. 🖥️

During those years of study I have learned various subjects and programming languages, such as python, which is a language widely used in artificial intelligence. I also learned about cybersecurity as it is important to keep software safe and detect vulnerabilities. 🛡️

One of the subjects that I have learned is mathematics, since it is one of my passions like computing. And the same mathematics can help us solve problems and create new technologies. 📚
