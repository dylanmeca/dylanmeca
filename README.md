# Dylan Meca

I'm Dylan Meca, a student specializing in computer science and physics. My main field of interest is artificial intelligence, and I have spent time and effort learning various subjects and programming languages ​​related to this area, such as python. 💻  

I have also been interested in system administration, since I understand the importance of maintaining the stability and performance of systems and detecting problems to protect our systems. 👨‍💻

Physics is another of my areas of interest, and I have learned about how we can use its principles to solve problems and create new technologies. I continue to learn and develop my skills in both areas of study. 📚
