# Dylan Meca

I am Dylan Meca, a student specialized in computer science and mathematics. I am also a software developer and a computer programmer. 

Thanks to my computer science studies, I was able to understand how technology works. I also learned computer security, since today cybersecurity is necessary to avoid dangers. ðŸ›¡ 

One of the things that I have learned is mathematics, since it is one of my passions like computer science and at the same time mathematics like physics are used to calculate speed and other interesting things.
