# Dylan Meca

I am Dylan Meca, a student specialized in computer science, especially in the area of machine learning and I also specialize in the area of mathematics. ðŸ’»

During those years of study I have learned various subjects and programming languages, such as python, which is a language widely used in machine learning. One of the reasons why I consider python a recommended language is because of its ease of learning and because you could specialize in quantum computing thanks to the IBM library called Qiskit.

One of the subjects that I have learned is mathematics, since it is one of my passions like computing. And the same mathematics can help us solve problems and create new technologies.
